## Future Plans:
* Settings for font size, dark/light mode, 12 vs 24 hour time, etc
* ~~Add an "About" and "Bug Report" page~~ Done!
* "Pull Down to Refresh" calls page
* Add a way to get from the "Stream" page back to the "Favorites" or "Systems" without going back three levels
* If playing, play button should stop playback
* ~~Timestamp should have date~~ Done!
* "Load More" button under last call in list
* "Advanced Search" page
* Keep last position on app start
* Fix the thing where it refreshes every 5 seconds, figure out how to properly stream data
